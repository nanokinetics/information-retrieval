# Information Retrieval

Practicing and working in the field of information retrieval implicity encompasses machine learning aspects. More or less, the fields complement each other. However, an essential understanding of machine learning fundamentals help gain momentum in IR.  

1. Introduction 
2. The basics of how to index and query unstructured data 
3. Pre-processing the data prior to indexing: building the term vocabulary, posting lists 
4. Dealing with spelling errors: tolerant retrieval 
5. Scaling up to large datasets 
6. How to improve performance by compressing the index 
7. Ranking the results: scores and the vector space model 
8. Evaluating the quality of information retrieval: relevance 
9. Query expansion 
10. Structured retrieval: when the data is not quite unstructured (XML or HTML) 
11. Alternate approach: Probabilistic information retrieval 
12. Alternate approach: Language models 
13. Crawling the Web 
14. Link analysis (PageRank)
